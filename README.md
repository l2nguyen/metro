## Study of Metro Ridership
This is the class project for my General Assembly Data Science class.

**Goals:** 
* To visualize the DC Metro rail historical ridership data
* To determine the variables that affect ridership
* To build a model that detremines the relationship between the outcome, metrorail ridership, and the feature variables (ie gas price, weather, unemployment)

**Game Plan:**
* This is a regression problem and I plan to use a linear regression model 
* The main model evaluation tool will be RMSE
* Will make models of increasing complexity and see what works best

**Guide:**
* A detailed report can be found [here](Report.md)
* Graphs visualizing data can be found [here](Graphs)
* Data wrangling code can be found [here](Code/wrangling.py)
* Modelling code can be found [here](Code/modeling.py)
* Data dictionary can be found [here](Documentation.pdf)

**To Do List**
* Clean up wrangling and modeling code to be more elegant/shorter
* Parameter tuning of the models
* Add data for days when sports games exis
* Find better proxy for tourism

**Wish List**
* Make interactive data visualizations using javascript/d3. Maybe something like [this](http://mbtaviz.github.io/)
