# Study of Metro Ridership
This is the class project for my GA Data Science project.

**Goals:** 
* To visualize the DC Metro rail historical ridership data
* To determine the variables that affect ridership
* To build a model that detremines the relationship between riderhsip and the input variables

Initial class presentation


**Data Sources:**
* Metro Ridership Data from [Open Data DC](http://www.opendatadc.org/dataset/wmata-metrorail-ridership-by-date)
* Gas price data from [US Energy Information Administration](http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_r1z_m.htm)
* Unemployment data from [US Bureau of Labor Stats](http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.dc_washington_md.htm)
(Note: Data is for Washington DC Metro area which includes DC and other areas such as NoVA, Montgomery County, PG County, and parts of WV)
* Weather data from [NOAA](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools)
(Note: I used data from the National Arboretum station)

**Wish List:**
* Make interactive data visualizations using javascript/d3. Maybe something like [this](http://mbtaviz.github.io/)
